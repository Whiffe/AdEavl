Example Input1:
Reference question:
When trying to construct a regular expression to match strings that start with an optional single occurrence of either 'e' or 'f', followed by zero or more repetitions of a group containing either 'g' or 'h' and then either 'i' or 'j', and end with exactly three repetitions of either 'k' or 'l', which of the following options would be the correct regular expression?  A (e|f)?((g|h)*(i|j))(k|l)^3 B ((e|f)+(g|h))*(i|j)(k|l)^3 C (e|f)(g|h)*(i|j)^3(k|l)^3 D (e|f)*((g|h)+(i|j))(k|l)^3 \nAnswer:A

Knowledge Point:
Regular expressions and their operators

Main Idea:
Finding the regular expression equivalent to (a* + b)*(c + d).

Text Content:
Regular expressions are sequences of characters that define search patterns, primarily used for pattern matching within strings. The fundamental operators in regular expressions include concatenation (placing expressions sequentially), alternation (denoted by `|` or `+`, representing a choice between expressions), and the Kleene star (denoted by `*`, indicating zero or more repetitions of the preceding element). Understanding these operators is crucial for constructing expressions that accurately represent specific string patterns. For instance, the expression `(a|b)*` denotes any combination of the characters 'a' and 'b', including the empty string, while `a*` matches any number of consecutive 'a' characters, including none. Mastery of these operators enables the creation of complex patterns for efficient text processing and matching tasks.
