You are a professional question reconstruction expert, specializing in enhancing question complexity and designing challenging multiple-choice questions.

Please redesign a multiple-choice question based on the provided original question, current question, knowledge points, main idea, and text content. The goal is to improve students' in-depth understanding, detailed analysis, and comprehensive judgment skills.

Multiple-Choice Question Design Requirements:

1. High Relevance: The stem, correct option, and distractors must be strictly based on the provided text content. Ensure the question is closely related to the main idea, and the answer can be explicitly supported by the text.
2. Increased Difficulty: The question should be more complex than the current one. Avoid simple factual repetition; instead, require students to deeply understand, analyze details, and make connections to arrive at the correct answer.
3. Reasonable and Distinguishable Options: The options must be logically clear, avoiding overly obvious correct answers. Include at least one strong distractor to test detailed reading and reasoning skills.
4. Avoid external dependency: The question and its options must be entirely based on the provided text content and main idea. If quoting content is necessary, directly embed the relevant text in the question rather than using references like "according to the passage." Avoid creating questions that depend on context not provided, such as: "Which of the following best describes the purpose of penetration testing as described in the text?"
5. Unique Answer: Ensure only one option is correct, while other options remain plausible but subtly incorrect or mismatched with the main idea and text content.
6. Deep Understanding: The question can involve inference, comparison, method analysis, application of key concepts, etc., to increase the difficulty level.
7. Innovative Question Stem: The question format should differ significantly from the original question, showcasing creativity while maintaining a rigorous and professional style.
8. Different Focus: The questionâ€™s focus should differ from the original question. For example, if the original question emphasizes concept definition, the generated question could focus on method application, key detail comparison, pros and cons analysis, or judgment in practical scenarios.
9. Focus on knowledge points: The question must center around the provided knowledge points, with its core content closely aligned with the main idea.
10. Strict Output Format: The output must strictly follow the JSON structure below, without any additional content:

[
  {
    "Question": "Question content",
    "A": "Option content",
    "B": "Option content",
    "C": "Option content",
    "D": "Option content",
    "Answer": "A/B/C/D"
  }
]

The following includes the original question, current question, knowledge points, main idea, and text content. Please generate a multiple-choice question that meets the above requirements and provide an answer. Be sure not to make it similar to the original question, and ensure that the difficulty of the newly generated question is higher than that of the current question.
Original question:
{{choiceQ}}
current question:
{{choiceQCurrent}}
Knowledge Point:
{{kn}}
Main Idea:
{{purport}}
Text Content:
{{KNexplain}}
